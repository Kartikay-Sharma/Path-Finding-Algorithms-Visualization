# Path Finding Algorithms Visualization
This project is a visualization tool for path finding algorithms. The tool aims to provide a visual representation of popular pathfinding algorithms such as:
1. Dijkstra's Algorithm
2. A* Search Algorithm
3. Bidirectional Algorithm
4. Breadth-First Search Algorithm
6. Depth-First Search Algorithm

## Features
- Implementation and Visualization of Path Finding Algorithms
- User can add walls/obstacles and algorithms will find new path while considering these walls 
- Random Maze Generation using Recursive Division

## User Interaction
- Right Click - Revert start, end or wall cell to a normal cell
- Left Click - Designate a normal cell to wall cell
- Buttons - Choose a path finding algorithm, clear the grid or generate a random maze  

Note: After removing a start or end cell (by right click) user can reinstate them by left-clicking on any cell before starting an algorithm
